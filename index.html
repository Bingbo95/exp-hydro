      <p>EXP-HYDRO is a catchment scale hydrological model that operates at a daily time-step. It takes as inputs the daily values of precipitation, air temperature, and potential evapotranspiration, and simulates daily streamflow at the catchment outlet. This model was originally developed by Dr Sopan Patil in 2010 as part of his PhD research. Our research group (<a href="http://sopanpatil.weebly.com">http://sopanpatil.weebly.com</a>) continues its active development in both spatially lumped and spatially distributed configurations. The source code provided is written in Python programming language and has been tested using Python 2.7. Data from a sample catchment in Wales are also provided in the SampleData folder to test the model code.</p>

<p>Following execution files are provided for running EXP-HYDRO, which can be modified by the users as per their requirements:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Run_exphydro_lumped_pso.py</strong>: Performs a calibration and validation run of the lumped EXP-HYDRO model using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Run_exphydro_distributed_pso.py</strong>: Performs a calibration and validation run of the distributed EXP-HYDRO model using PSO algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong> Please make sure that the following Python packages are installed on your computer before running any of the above execution files:
(1) NumPy (<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">http://www.numpy.org/</a>)
(2) SciPy (<a href="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</a>)
(3) matplotlib (<a href="http://matplotlib.org/">http://matplotlib.org/</a>)</p>
